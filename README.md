## 📦 Project List & Descriptions

### 1. ✨ **GenAI-Powered Routine Planner with Sentiment Analysis**
An AI-based daily planner that uses Generative AI to automatically organize tasks based on priority and user sentiment. Real-time voice sentiment analysis adjusts task suggestions dynamically, helping users stay productive and balanced.

**Tech Stack:**  
- Streamlit, Python, LLaMA model, Sentiment Analysis (TextBlob/Hugging Face)  
- Google Calendar Sync, Email & WhatsApp notifications  

---

### 2. 📊 **Automated Preprocessing, Visualization, and Storytelling using GenAI**
An intelligent system that automates data cleaning, visualization, and generates insights using natural language storytelling powered by Generative AI (Qwen model). Supports both text and image datasets.

**Tech Stack:**  
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, GenAI (Qwen)  
- Data cleaning, visual generation, and automated report creation

### 4. 💵 **Currency Recognition using CNN**
A computer vision system that recognizes Indian currency notes using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Assists visually impaired individuals or automated systems in currency detection.

**Tech Stack:**  
- Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV  
- Trained CNN model for real-time currency recognition  

---

### 5. 🎯 **YOLOv8 Object Detection with Buzzer & Mail Alert System**
An object detection system using YOLOv8 integrated with real-time alerts. When a specific object is detected (e.g., intrusion), a buzzer is activated and an email alert is sent.

**Tech Stack:**  
- Python, YOLOv8, OpenCV, SMTP (Email), Hardware integration (Buzzer)
